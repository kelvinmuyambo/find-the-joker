##TIME-BASED V FRAME-BASED
###TIME BASED ANIMATION
Time-based animation is where movement and animation depend on the elapsed time, meaning that at a given time an object will be at a specific position displaying a specific frame.
###FRAME BASED ANIMATION
Frame-based animation where movement is constant and no frames of an animation are skipped. This depends on a constant FPS. On slow machines the animation will be slow but smooth.
