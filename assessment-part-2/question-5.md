##REDUX DESIGN PATTERN
Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions". It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion.

###USES OF REDUX
1. When you have large amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app
2. When the app state is updated frequently over time
3. When the logic to update that state may be complex
4. When the app has a medium or large-sized codebase, and might be worked on by many people
